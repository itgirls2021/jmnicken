        <h2>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h2>

            The video below shares a road map and summary on web development and web design for beginners. I found this video very helpful because it explained the basics of web development through clear visuals and understandable references. It helped me get a clear sense of what I am doing in IT Girls’ web development Labs. Enjoy!

        <h3>Day 1 - Cryptology</h3>
        <p>Jayla Nickens / July 20th, 2021</p>
        <p>
            This is not actually the first day of IT Girls. The first day was introductions and a review of the Syllabus, but July 20th is when the fun starts. We met and learned from Lauren Hardee-Chase, an expert in cryptology. She went over a brief history of cryptology, women in cryptology, types of cryptography methods, and learned how to encode and decode encrypted messages using the standard Caesar Cipher method. I truly enjoyed the session with her and the lab. I learned something new and something to share with my friends who are not a part of IT Girls.

        <h3>Day 2 - Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Jayla Nickes / July, 22nd</p>
        <p>
            This lesson has opened my eyes to how computers, entertainment applications, and even cars can memorize your movements from data. Then, recommend games, tv-shows, and places you might like. For example, when YouTube recommends videos for me to watch it’s either content from people I’m subscribed to or a video that is similar to an art tutorial I searched up yesterday. Most of the time the recommendations are something I like, but there are very few times when I find the suggested content uninteresting. For this session we tested machine learning abilities by training a computer to recognize your images, sounds, or poses. I decided to see if the computer can differentiate me and my sister's voices by uploading separate audio of us speaking and one sample of the background noises. The results were not as accurate as I wanted them to be, but I think more samples of us speaking and a sample of all potential background noises would help improve the results.
