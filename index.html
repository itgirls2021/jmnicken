        <h1>Jayla Nickens' Biography</h1>
        <p>
            I'm an upcoming senior at Friendship Collegiate Acadmey and I'm from Washington, DC. I have a large and crazy-in-love family. For a hoddy I paint, draw, and knit/crochet. I don't have a favorite TV show or movie, but I'm always binge watching something. Outside of school I'm very chill, out-going, and love adventures. I decided to take this class because I wanted to explore different fields of study in summer, so I can feel more confident when I decide what to major in college. I already know the basics of technology, enjoy the aspects of computer science, and I love the idea of diversifying the IT community. I'm interested in Data Analytics and I want to become a Cognitive Psychologist, so I think this is a great opportunity to learn more about myself, and solidify my objective.
